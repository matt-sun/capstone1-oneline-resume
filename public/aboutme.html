<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I enjoy various activities and learning new hobbies! But some things are
  constants in my life. While this may change very soon, here are my current key
  interests!
</p>
<h2>Food</h2>
<p>
  I love to both cook and eat food. If I had multiple stomachs, they'd all be as
  full as my solo one I currently have. Can't stop (won't stop).

<p>
  This is one of my latest meals from my trip in HK @ Ding Tai Fung, amazing and
  fairly cheap!
</p>
<h2>Travels</h2>
<p>
  Not very eco-friendly, although some interesting alternatives exist. Trying to
  be more concious about my footprint, but it's a very hard sacrifice that I
  might not make right away (forgive me).

<p>
  Again, me during my return flight from Hong Kong to Paris, a very empty plane!
</p>
<h2>Sports</h2>
<h3>Running</h3>
<p>
  Got into the trend since I almost 30, quite cathartic, although I've lost the
  habit very recently. Gotta get back into it depsite the colder days!

<p>
  Never knew midnight sports sessions could feel so good. Also, you sleep very
  well afterwards.
</p>
<h3>Climbing</h3>
<p>Haven't been there in a while but want to now that I have more time!</p>

<p>The old climbing gym I used to go to, should I pop by again?</p>
<h3>Skiing</h3>
<p>
  Ski season is around the corner, already have a first trip planned, why not
  more!

<h2>Gaming</h2>
<p>
  Started in Middle School with my first MMORPG Dofus (OGs know), been a
  (serious) gamer since I entered Engineering school (skipping classes was the
  key), and it has been an integral part of my life since then (although I do
  play way less since I've started working).

<p>
  Currently playing several games, but the new TFT season is on, so will start
  grinding it soon!
</p>
<h2>Dogs</h2>
<p>
  I love dogs. All dogs. But I especially LOVE Corgis. I have no idea why. But I
  love them.
</p>

<p>
  Here's a big photo of some dogs I met in Hong Kong. Very chill dogs. The best
  dogs ever. Not Corgis, but still very cute.
