    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I am result-driven and love solving problems. I come from an Engineering
      background and did research in Applied Physics.<br /><br />
      I initially wanted to pursue my career in Theoretical Physics, but life
      decided otherwise and put me in Sales and Management. I then grew into
      strategy and operational roles to leverage my analytical skills and apply
      them into growing businesses at a higher level. <br /><br />I am now
      learning Web Development to go expand my field of expertise.
